HSPS is command-line tool that can be used to deploy SharePoint 2007 content such as
lists, libraries, pages and workflows. It is a better tool than SharePoint designer
Personal Web Packages because once you have applied a pckage to SharePoint site, there
is no way you can import another package in site.

You can define your lists and other contents using XAML and HSPS will deploy it for you.
So basically it is a define once and deploy multiple times process.

There is sample package in a folder called "Sample Package" in bin\debug folder that 
you can use.
